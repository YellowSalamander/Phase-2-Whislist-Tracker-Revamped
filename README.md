# Wishlist Deal Tracker
This is a JavaScript application that allows users to search for games they wanna purchase using the CheapShark API and utilize it to find the best price accross multiple store-fronts. Users can enter a search term and retrieve a list of games that match the search. They can then select games from the search results and add them to their selected games list for further tracking as the prices are fetched in real time. The page also re-directs you to the correct store-front were the best deal is being hosted (mock response at the time)
